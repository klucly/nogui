# NOGUI

Thats the game engine where you can make programs
without gui `(Like in console)` very easy


# Installation

Well, you have to download this. There is no other ways, haha


# Configuring

In the `/nogui/__init__.py` in the up of file you will see this lines:

```python

install_packages = True
use_local_console = True

```

`install_packeges` is to install packages, what the engine needs

`use_local_console` is to use special console for this engine
* If `True` you need [`pygame`,](https://github.com/pygame/pygame) speed of programs will be increased by the few times
* If `False` you need [`keyboard`](https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard) and if you have linux you have to run files with a root
